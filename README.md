# Responsive Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The page is designed to be simple, clean, and visually appealing, promoting a travel website called "SoulTravel." 
It features elements such as buttons, inputs for destinations and dates, and informative sections related to booking flights, hotels, tour guides, and local events, but they are solely included for design and layout purposes.
